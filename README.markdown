FdSymbol - A math symbol font
=============================

FdSymbol is a math symbol font, designed as a companion to the
[Fedra family](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts) by Typotheque, but it might also fit other contemporary
typefaces.

Usage
-----

To use this font in LaTeX, include

    \usepackage{fdsymbol}

in the preamble of your LaTeX document. See the [PDF documentation](latex/fdsymbol.pdf)
for the details.

If you are interested in a full integration with [Fedra Serif](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/fedra-serif), take a look at the [fedraserif](https://github.com/ummels/fedraserif) package. 

Installation
------------

Building the fonts requires Metafont (>=2.718281), FontForge (>=20201107) and
Python 3 with the `fontforge` module enabled.

Rebuilding the FontForge source files from the Metafont sources additionally requires
MetaPost (>=1.902) and mf2pt1 (>= 2.5).

To install the fonts, the accompanying LaTeX package and the documentation
in your home texmf tree, run:

    make install

If you want to use a different texmf tree, you can specify it using the
variable TEXMFDIR:

    make install TEXMFDIR=/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

Afterwards, you may need to regenerate the file database:

    texhash

Finally, you need to activate the map file:

    updmap-user --enable Map=fdsymbol.map

For a system-wide installation, replace updmap-user by updmap-sys.
